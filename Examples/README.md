# Ez-Animations - Examples
Here you can find some examples on how to use the library to create you own implementation of the module.<br>

There are 2 main examples, each implemented in tkinter & PyQt5.

* Example 1 - When the button is clicked, it will move, and complete a full rotation along the border. 
* Example 2 - When any button is clicked, all the buttons will move from left to right and back, in diffrent speed, based on their y coordinates using the same animation script for all.
